<span style="text-decoration: underline">The primary, overall objective of the HUGIN-MUNIN project is to develop new deep neural network
technology with general, robust models that will enable large-scale use of HTR as part of the
standard digitization process of Norwegian LAM collections without the need for massive and on-
going manual annotation and model training.</span>

In order to attain the primary project objective, new methods will be developed that go beyond
traditional supervised machine learning, by using <span style="text-decoration: underline">active learning, unsupervised learning, transfer
learning, and zero-shot learning</span>.

The HUGIN-MUNIN project aims to go beyond the current state-of-the-art AI supervised deep neural
network document processing workflow described above. Instead of a typical current HTR digitization
workflow, resulting in a static model incapable of incorporating new information collected about new
writers or document types, HUGIN-MUNIN will develop a way to automatically adapt the model to
new information by integrating a self-supervised adaptation process to the recognition process. Thus,
the project both addresses <span style="text-decoration: underline">state-of-the-art AI for handwriting recognition</span> and introduces the
integration of an <span style="text-decoration: underline">automated, self-learning adaptation process for a dynamic user influenced model,
capable of continuously evolving with the addition of information about new writers, content, and
document features.</span>

Key to the project will be an <span style="text-decoration: underline">interdisciplinary collaboration</span> between specialized research communities
within document analysis and HTR, both nationally and internationally. This will <span style="text-decoration: underline">expand Norwegian
experience and competence in AI/autonomous systems expertise</span> and enhance the <span style="text-decoration: underline">innovative
potential of the Norwegian LAM sector</span> through transfer of knowledge and best practices.
